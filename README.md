> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To add custom plugins, you need to build Vencord from the source. Follow [this Guide](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) if you haven't done this yet

> [!WARNING]  
> This plugin uses a custom API. Just to let you know, requests will be sent to my API. However, no IP addresses are logged. The API is open source and you can self-host it if you prefer. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/domi-btnr/ClientModBadges-API)
